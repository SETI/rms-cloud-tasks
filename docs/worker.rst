Worker API Reference
==================

.. warning::
   This documentation is a placeholder. The Worker API is still under development.

Introduction
-----------

The Cloud Tasks Worker API provides a framework for implementing workers that process tasks from cloud provider queues. This API abstracts away the complexities of cloud-specific implementations, allowing you to focus on your task processing logic.

Basic Usage
----------

Here's a simple example of how to implement a worker:

.. code-block:: python

   from cloud_tasks.worker import Worker

   class MyTaskWorker(Worker):
       async def process_task(self, task_id, task_data):
           """Process a single task."""
           print(f"Processing task {task_id}")
           # Your processing logic here
           print(f"Task data: {task_data}")
           # Return results if needed
           return {"status": "success", "processed_at": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z"}

   # Run the worker
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       worker = MyTaskWorker(
           provider="aws",
           queue_name="my-task-queue",
           config_file="cloud_tasks_config.yaml"
       )
       worker.run()

Worker Configuration
------------------

The worker can be configured using the following parameters:

- `provider`: The cloud provider to use (aws, gcp, azure)
- `queue_name`: The name of the queue to process
- `config_file`: Path to the configuration file
- `poll_interval`: How often to check for new tasks in seconds
- `batch_size`: Maximum number of tasks to process in parallel
- `visibility_timeout`: How long to keep tasks invisible to other workers

Advanced Worker Features
----------------------

Task Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The worker provides the following task handling capabilities:

- Automatic task acknowledgement after successful processing
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Dead letter queue support
- Task prioritization
- Batch processing

Health Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~

Workers can implement health checks to monitor their status:

.. code-block:: python

   class MyTaskWorker(Worker):
       async def health_check(self):
           """Implement custom health check logic."""
           # Check resources, connections, etc.
           return {"status": "healthy", "queue_name": self.queue_name}

Graceful Shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Workers can implement graceful shutdown logic:

.. code-block:: python

   class MyTaskWorker(Worker):
       async def shutdown(self):
           """Clean up resources before shutting down."""
           print("Worker shutting down...")
           # Close connections, flush logs, etc.
           await super().shutdown()

Worker Class
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   class Worker:
       def __init__(self, provider, queue_name, config_file=None, **kwargs):
           """Initialize the worker."""
           pass

       async def process_task(self, task_id, task_data):
           """Process a single task. Must be implemented by subclasses."""
           raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement process_task method")

       async def run(self):
           """Start the worker and begin processing tasks."""
           pass

       async def health_check(self):
           """Perform a health check. Can be overridden by subclasses."""
           pass

       async def shutdown(self):
           """Clean up resources and gracefully shut down."""
           pass

Future Enhancements
-----------------

The following features are planned for future releases:

- Distributed worker coordination
- Enhanced metrics and monitoring
- Horizontal scaling support
- Worker middleware support
- Enhanced task routing
