- Document the high-level architecture of the software, including class hierarchy, API, and interface contracts. Keep this document up-to-date at all times.
- Document how the software is to be installed and run, both locally and in production. Keep this document up-to-date at all times.
- All classes, methods, and functions must include descriptive docstrings.
- Any code change must update relevant docstrings and the README.
